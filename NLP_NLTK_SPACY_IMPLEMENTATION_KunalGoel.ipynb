The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost.

The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!\\nNow, off to the device.\\n\\nPros\\nThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.\\nSpeakers sound better than my previous phone.\\nA couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!\\nOS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.\\nCamera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.\\n\\nCons\\nRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.\\nCouple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.\\nNo 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.\\n\\nOverall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.\",\n",

Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I\\'ll just list out a few points regarding the phone:\\nPros:\\nA great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]\\nThe best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]\\nSomewhere between great to excellent battery life\\nThe software experience is great if you\\'re into \"apple way\" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDIC\\nThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it\\'s sides are alluminium and not steel.\\n\\nCons:\\nMany buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there\\'s just no escaping that fact.\\nYou will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.\\nThe display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she\\'s not a tech geek and she\\'s loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.\\nAnd also if you\\'re into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.\\n\\nConclusion with personal thoughts:\\nOverall the phone is a great one if you\\'re not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone.

Premium feel at hand & ease of use especially after coming a decade of being Android user.\\n2. No battery heating or draining. Lasts for about 3days with very casual usage - office call, mails, few apps. Please note i have not installed any games or heavy intense apps.\\n3. Camera quality is the best that i have experienced.\\n4. Face ID works like charm & very useful in authentication while installing apps or view the notifications on lock screen.\\n5. Call quality, data connection & connectivity felt immediately better compared to my earlier phone.\\n\\nCons\\n1. Only nick picking on the charger not being provided in this new version. IF you have any USB C charger at home, you can leverage the same to charge this phone since USB C cable is provided.\\n2. Cannot use 3.5mm jack based headsets. Need Bluetooth headset or lightening port connectors.\\n\\nPer my experience, I would definitely recommend iPhone11 since i do not see any potential cons.

Just the exchange process is very very complex\\nIf you are exchanging an old phone strongly recommend not to do so. If you wish to do so here are the steps\\n\\n1. Please take complete back up in advance of the phone you like to exchange\\n2. Erase all data except Amazon app. Even if you have the Amazon app on a different phone, please have Amazon app installed on the phone which you are going to give away\\n3. Once the delivery agent comes to you, ask for a pin 6 digit number.\\n4. You have to first enter the six digit number on the phone in the Amazon app on the order. Yes, this has to be keyed in on same order you had made and there is a provision space to enter on same.\\n5. This step is quite complex but this is done for security to ensure you exchange the right phone.\\n6. Once validated (Takes about 10 to 30 minutes depending on data / passwords you have stored) you then have to provide a 6 digit OTP which you would have received on your mobile and email.\\n7. Then the agent verifies the 6 digit OTP on his device.\\n8. If this gets done, PLEASE ENSURE YOU REMOVE YOUR SIM , DELETE THE AMAZON APP AND DATA FROM THE device you are going to give away.\\n9. Final but most important - ensure the device is deleted from iCloud if you are exchanging iPhone . If non iPhone ensure you format the phone and ONLY THEN HAND IT OVER TO DELIVERY AGENT.\\n10. In any possibility it would take 10 to 45 minutes to complete the exchange steps above depending on your data on phone plus the support of delivery or customer service.\\nI had to wait for 24 hours to re do all steps and then went for it as I urgently needed this phone.

       " \"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!\\n\\nThis is why I decided against a new OnePlus:\\n1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.\\n2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.\\n3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.\\nThat said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.\\n\\nI'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.\\n\\nFirst, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.\\n\\nAppearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.\\n\\nUser interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.\\n\\nCamera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.\\n\\nSpeaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.\\n\\nCharger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.\\n\\nearphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.\\n\\nOverall user experience:\\nPros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.\\nDownloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.\\nCall signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.\\nDon’t worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn’t you just need to use your passcode so it isn’t bad. For the most part it’s quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.\\nCons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.\\n2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.\\n3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.\\n\\nOne other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.\\n\\nHope this review helps next buyer.\",\n",

That means no one can unlock your phone while you’re asleep so your phone is secure. Also you can unlock your phone even in dim to dark lit rooms or in absolutely no external light. The phone has lot’s of shortcuts making your use super easy and quick. No doubt about the security!

Switching from android to iOS i used battery of 6000mah which still is more than apple’s 3110mah but the ios battery management is really great. You can watch videos at max brightness for quite a long time on this plus if you’re a heavy gamer, you may have to charge the device maybe twice a day. Also the battery optimisation is an excellent feature which saves your device from overcharging.\\n4) camera\\nWell it’s iphone baby! Camera is excellent and most clear pictures and videos are captured from the camera. A 10/10 for camera and videos. If you’re into making content for YouTube or instagram, this phone’s camera would be perfect. Also the pictures captured are quite vivid.\\nFew cons of the device\\n1) The notch takes up little more space of the screen. I personally don’t find it annoying but few people may.\\n2) Phone may heat a little during charging.\\n3) If you bought this after selling your kidney, you must stay hydrated. Be very careful with your phone as even a little scratch would hurt your heart a lot.',\n",

Nowadays Amazon shopping experience is taking a nosedive as they started putting finer details of terms and conditions during the offer in so many places that it’s impossible to take screenshots of complete offer and it’s serve the purpose for amazon tactically as you cant have all details handy with you when you will complain with their customer care regarding not receiving the cashback. usually cashback come to the customer account only after sales end, So no way when you complain to the customer care executive you can show them the complete offer details and they are clueless about the offer anyways.\\n\\nSoon it seems Amazon shopping experience will also reach the level of unbearable like Flipkart. Time to go offline shopping now.\\n\\nBTW the phone is good. The camera is astonishing, the colour reproduction in the images taken from the iPhone is no doubt is best in the segment and hard for any phone to match that.

       " 'iPhone11 Review\\nA person who uses every major application of a phone such as a camera, notes, gaming, binge-watching, and also wants his phone to run smoothly for at least 3-5 years may go for iPhone11. According to my experience, I would suggest the iPhone11 as the best choice because I’ve been using Android for the last 5 years and the issue which I was facing with my phone was, it started to hang within 2-3 years of its purchase. It also began to overheat if I would continuously use its activities such as watching videos or playing games. Besides, the major issue with an android phone is privacy. It requires that data on mobile devices has to be transmitted to Google servers, which is used for targeted advertising. This makes Android a less private mobile operating system. I remember that whenever I used to search for a product on the Amazon app, my phone was flooded with ads of the searched product. So, to get rid of all of the above issues I thought to give a try to the iOS operating system instead of buying another Android phone. Apple is committed to its customer privacy, and their phones also come with a powerful CPU(Central Processing Unit) which makes them compatible to do with multitasking for a long duration without facing any problem. Among all the iPhone models, I found iPhone11 budget-friendly. Being the latest model it covered various shortcomings of old models. It has better performance, great durability, a dual-camera system, and many other features.\\nOne of the most important reasons why I chose the iPhone11 over former iPhones is that it comes with an A13 Bionic chip and is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone which falls under the price range of this phone. With this powerful beast, I can perform various multitasking without experiencing any lag. It also has the best GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) which allows you to watch videos at their highest graphics. I remember when I used to play games on my old phone it suddenly stop but now my experience with the new iPhone11 in terms of gaming is amazing, the whole game runs smoothly without any frame drop. However, I would not recommend gaming on iPhone11 for a long time because it starts to overheat. Additionally, its iOS 14 update is the best update I have ever seen on any smartphone. One of my favorite features in this update is ‘picture in Picture’ in which I can continue to watch a video or make a FaceTime while we are using another app. Such type of amazing applications help me to provide the best possible performance especially when I use my phone for multitasking.\\nApple claims that they had used the toughest glass on the back and in front in iPhone11 and its aluminum case provides extra durability to it. Apart from this it also comes IP68 rating which means it is fit enough to withstand dust, dirt, and is resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater. I had also seen many youtube videos in which people do the toughest test on iPhone11 such as they make it sink in the water for an elongated time and when they take it out it works completely the same as it was before. Such waterproofing makes it possible to take underwater pictures and videos which are pretty amazing.\\nIphones are already quite famous for their camera quality but it becomes even better with iPhone11. iPhone11 comes with an amazing dual-camera system which means that now users have a choice to shoot photos or videos in wide and ultra-wide mode. It also comes with stereoscopic depth which allows taking portraits of all the objects. It is one of the major changes that the iPhone has undertaken because, in earlier iPhones, users were able to take a portrait of the human face only. It also comes with night vision mode which helps to capture the photos in dim light places which is a very useful feature for me because as compared to my earlier phone there was no such option to do the same. It can be used for a variety of different hobbies such as if you are a vlogger you can use it to shoot videos in 4k and if you are an amateur photographer you can use it to capture the finest photo which can ever be taken on a smartphone.\\nAlong with that one of the crucial features that I like about the iPhone is its astonishing “continuity feature” that makes it seamless to connect all the Apple devices altogether. for example, through this feature, we can make cellular calls with any of the Apple devices which are connected to your iPhone.As I am also looking forward to buy a Macbook, this feature will help me a lot in completing my college assignments as with the help of this feature I can use my iPhone to scan documents or take a picture and have it appear instantly on my Mac, and Apple continues to add such type of incredible and unique features that can make your work easier.\\nBeing a college student I accept that Rs.72,0000 price tag seemed to be a little steepy but, my experience with this phone has proven it to be worth the cost. After years of purchasing random phones that promised me to provide the best experience in terms of durability, performance, camera quality it is the iPhone11 which finally delivered such claims. I personally recommend you to buy this complete package of the newest technology presently available.',\n",

I rigorously used it for few days & only then sharing the feedback. Face recognition, camera quality, processor performance & battery life are way better.

Though iPhone 11 supports 18W fast charging through USB Power delivery, it is not bundled with the new 18W Apple charger that comes with the Pro models. You will have to buy it (12 watt or 18 watt charger) separately, if you want to charge your phone quickly.

Eventually I never thought that I would be an Apple fan as I was a big time android user for 10 years.\\nWell I was about to buy one +8 pro and I was quite confused whether should I go with one +8 pro or iPhone 11. I compared both the phones and eventually I decided to go with iPhone 11 as one +8 pro camera is really not up to the mark for what we actually pay in fact if I want to compare Samsung M series phones have better camera than one +8 pro. Other than camera one +8 pro is really a top notch phone in terms of display and sound quality.\\nNo let’s talk about iPhone 11 and I am giving this review after 20 days of my usage & I am really a heavy user.\\nCamera as outstanding, top notch, till now and from past 10 years I have never seen a camera which is this amazing in terms of quality and shots infact night mode is extremely superb. The ultrawide camera is the best ultrawide camera which iPhone 11 gives and comparing iPhone 11 with one +8 pro it’s a shame even though one +8 pro gives a 48 megapixel camera it doesn’t give the best quality & filed of view.\\nTalking about performance trust me this has one of the powerful chipset if compared to snapdragon 865, Like really no other phone can beat it.\\nI don’t know what sampling rate iPhone 11 has but the display is amazingly smooth and silky; that touch response is a “WOW”\\nThe face recognition is amazing!! more than my expectations because it really doesn’t work like what android system is, The privacy and security which iPhone offers is the best.\\nNow talking about battery life it is really good when it comes to a standby mode but when you actually keep using the phone continuously, it drains out and maximum time you can use is just 5 hours 35 minutes. And charging time with 5W charger takes more than 2 hours 30 minutes.\\nTalking about build quality it is good, stylish, superb but kind of heavy as it has the best glass on both sides infact on the first day itself it fell down from a height of 4 feet and I was surprised that it didn’t break.\\nTalking about gaming, trust me it heats a lot. I mean I have played PUBG at high graphics as well as Asphalt 9 and the back panel does heat up quickly and at some point you cannot even hold it.\\nSo I would say, Buying an iPhone for gaming won’t be a good choice as it heats up a lot and playing continuously will definitely drain out the battery.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nI was quite worried to buy an iPhone from Amazon because there were lot of negative reviews and few of them said that it’s a fraud and they have been cheated but luckily in my case; 🤞🏼I really got the original product, a genuine one and I didn’t face any issue in terms of packaging.',\n",

Factor in your old iphone price, it comes around 40k, this was a deal worth taking!!\\nAlso, iphone 12 requires magsafe charger so add more to its price, plus 5G shall take atleast two more years to come, so not a good bargain for spending almost double.\\nBack to iPhone 11, it is no doubt a superb phone..11 feels so much more suave and classy, so much better user interface with ios14, so improved battery backup, earlier iPhone models users will definitely feel the difference, superb selfie camera with studio light in portrait mode and much more..\\n\\nOnly cons I felt is 5w charger supplied with it, which takes 3 hrs to charge the phone, if 18w charger can do the same in 1.5 hrs, why the same is not supplied? If Apple wants to give “amazing user experience” then it feels like a deal breaker, may be because of the fact that slow charging helps in prolonging the battery life, but then why option of 18w charger and shorten battery life, perhaps Apple also face the dilemma and done away with charger only now onwards..\\nOverall iPhone 11 makes more sense then 12 at this price point and in the absence of 5G currently in India.

       " \"I have been using 6s for past ~5yrs and made an economical swicth to Iphone 11, to stick to the simplified OS. For god sake, I could see so many cons in comparison with 6s, regretting my upgrade\\n1. Heavy!, expected, when I have switched from 6s, but its too heavy when compared to other phones of this size. May the same reason, ip12 is lighter\\n2. WIFI reception. ip6s did a very good job. almost at every part of my house, it was able to gather good signal. but ip11 literally struggles to even stay connected with WIFI at corners. it makes continuous switch between WIFI/cellular, annoys to to move to a different location. tried even with out the cover on.\\n3. Speakers at the bottom. I was thinking both the grill openings at the bottom were speakers. it turned out, i could hear music from only one of them. even i have planned to visit apple care to get the mobile checked. had some instinct to check it online before going, by then i was able find in apple discussions, that its microphone with speaker like grill.\\n4. Sound output - both through wired/wireless headphones. i could not hear anything in an crowded environment. even tried with multiple good earphones, the output is very low. this even a low end phone can do a better job. this might force me to move to a new phone may be.\\nAnd most imp is the call history, you cannot have more than 100 call records.. not sure, why apple have this policy. you gonna really miss some imp numbers, when we really get busy with continuous calls. And you cannot record your voice calls, when it’s really needed like in other ecosystem!\\nFeel, these are very basic setback to even consider it as a good phone. would definately not recommend anyone for ip11, rather would recommend ip12(if one can afford) or ip6s, if they could find in second hand market.(Yes, the size is small, but that does a better job). Even the former one, I'm not sure, as I haven't used hands-on.\",\n",
       " \"I am writing this review exactly after using this product for 1 month. I was skeptical after reading so many negative reviews for this phone but still took a chance to buy. I received the product the very next day with perfect packaging and everything intact. Purchased this product for around 46k after receiving debit card discount. Unboxed it and there was this premium looking phone. I have received all the accessories and a brand new product.\\nI was an android user for past 11 years so using this product was an entirely different experience.\\n\\nPros:\\n1. Superb processor- My iphone has not hanged a single time while using regressively. 10+ apps are opened at once still it was buttery smooth\\n2. Amazing camera- The night mode feature of the camera seal the deal with good potrait mode\\n3. Battery lasting for a day- I have always heard from my friends that iPhone doesn't have a good battery back up but this model is lasting for a day which is sufficient\\n4. No heating issue- I have not faced any heating issue till date\\n5. Security- The phone has good features for securing the data and doesn't have unnecessary applications\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Charger- The charger provided with this phone is just not sufficient. It takes 3 hours to charge my phone\\n2. No 3.5mm jack- It doesn't have a designated port for connecting your normal headphones. You have to buy expensive jack of 900rs from apple stores\\n3. Slo mo video- The slo mo videos created on the phone creates distorted image and feels like it has been taken by a 2 year old child who cannot hold the phone still.\\n4. Customisation- An android user knows how easy it is to customize their phone according to their preference. You can customise a little on iphone but it is very limited.\\n5. Expensive- iPhone which costs around 50k also needs accessories which are expensive like fast charger for around 1900rs, 3.5mm lightening jack 900rs, icloud storage 75rs/month, apple care etc.\\n\\nOverall I am really impressed with the product and these cons can somewhat be neglected if you're an iPhone user for a long time.\",\n",

Nokia was ahead of time. Data Security is good on iphone but don't forget that NYPD (New York Police department ) used Nokia Windows Phones for secure communication during its time. Even Nokia Android Phones are most secure compared to others on Android Platform except Pixel.\\nCamera : Selfie Camera is average and my Nokia 9 takes superb selfie images although the SW in Nokia is too slow,\\nMain Camera is an example of better coupling of Apple HW and SW which give some of the best images. Nokia 9 too takes a professional grade images but at the cost of slow SW and over exposure in some light conditions.\\nFelt iphone 11 bit broader by 2 mm to master the usage in one hand , also not providing justice to its interface which has flexibility to use in one hand in certain use cases. But still menu navigation requires both hands.. Which is opposite to Android 10 Gesture Navigation.\\nAfter two weeks usage i found bugs in Siri Assistant - Fails to get directions for some places on Apple Maps and also on Google maps --- Spending big money for this silly bug is super waste.\\nBeing typical Indian user reluctant to pay 20 Rupees for a ringtone , Wallpaper on App store - Lets me down.\\nWhatsapp Chats cant backed up from Android device for free ..

You can do color corrections later with the app.\\n\\nConclusion: If you're a camera person who wants to take more realistic pictures or raw images and cannot afford iPhone 12 now, go for 11. You won't regret, I promise.\\n\\nPS: The images I have attached are at extreme low light condition. In other words, with naked eyes, it was much more darker.\",\n",

Display is good, though its not an amoled screen or O-led, but the screen is bright enough under sunlight. The charger provided is a 5watt charger, which takes around 2 hour 30 minutes to charge the battery from 15% to 100%. User has to be a little careful with the battery. Heavy user will have to charge the device twice a day. After using Anroid for all these years it actually quite interesting to use an iOs device. Security on the device has to be mentioned. The face lock works seamlessly, even in pitch dark conditions. Everytime an app is downloaded, face recognition is must. Sharing of photos and documentaries is actually not tough these days with so many applications available. I am having a great time with my 1st ever Iphone.

Second is battery - you get a 3095 mah battery which gave me a full day battery backup with normal using , If you are using an android device with 5000-6000 MAH battery then you really need to think about this device otherwise great backup because I was using a Nokia smartphone earlier which was giving me full day battery backup so I don’t have any issue with this battery.\\nSo This Is My Experience With This Device I Like This Device and I Am Very Happy With My Purchase , Thanks To Amazon’s For Delivering Me This Great Beast .',\n",

       " \"10 months ago\\ni've had android for 5 years i was looking for a change in pace when i switched over to boost. My first iphone was a 6s Plus with boost mobile, after having it for a week i became an iphone fan. i overall enjoyed the camera, processing power,and the polarizing display. What i did not like was the battery life, that aspect needed improvement. When the boost guy at store mentioned i could get a new phone through payments i looked into a new device because i did not enjoy the battery life lasting me 4 to 6 hours after being charged 100%. So after talking to apple experts and even samsung enthusiasts i came to the cross road of the s10e and iphone 11 (the regular) and decided to give a go on the iphone 11 after the store rep mentioned iphones pick up better compared to samsung in the area i live. SURE ENOUGH!!! spots with no signal..BOOM! SERVICE! now keep in mind im not saying you'll have service every where you go due to some areas having no service, but i can vouch that areas my iphone 6s plus struggled to load or pick up a siganl bar at drastically improved. ALONG WITH BATTERY LIFE!!! this phone lasts me 10 to 12 hours off a single charge. keep in mind no i do not use low power mode thats just how good the battery life is on the iphone 11. lastly, i know there's android devices on the market that boast a big screen, long lasting battery life, and good cameras which are cheaper compared to iphones but thats the problem i kept running into was finding a durable phone. after 5 years of using the android platform i went through 8 or 10 devices from zte, lg, and samsung. all because the storage was too full, or because an antennae or battery had burned out. from what i hear iphone 11 users should expect a life span of 3 years. thats pretty good considering i go through phones because of internal issues not physical damage like crazyyy!!! overall look the iphone 11 is engineered quality in the camera, storage, battery, processing and display department. the price is well worth THE QUALITY put into this phone\",\n",

Comparing experience only few of the camera features can be rated as excellent otherwise its better to avoid iphone dual sim models.\\nThe major problem faced by me is whenever I am using wifi the network of the carriers (airtel/jio) goes off... so in other sense I cannot use wifi , also if I make a call from one number the other network is off so if I am on a official call all my personal contacts /family members cannot call me....other than this for sending text messages there is only one default number and you have to go to setting for using other number for imessages.

I am not blaming other people for the fraud on them, they maybe right but right now I am satisfied with the product. Speaking about battery life you should buy a 18watt fast charger either through apple store online or through third party companies such as anker. Slightly less battery backup can be compromised by fast charging.\",\n",

This is my first iPhone and hell yeah I’m in love with it (also I cracked a great deal on this). If you wanna by your first iPhone you can consider this. But if you have iPhone X or above model right now and considering to buy This,then This phone’s Bazeels ( sorry don’t know the correct wordings or so) are gonna irritate you a lot!

If you go to the spec sheet of an Android even if you have 6GB or 8GB (not stock android) of RAM it’s gonna Hang at some point after accessing many apps.\\n- The phone heats up less as compared to normal Androids.\\n- The Sound quality of iPhones are immersive! Even if you’re not a big fan of listening to music or sounds on speaker you’ll still find a quality sound!\\n- About the camera, hats off to the sensors and AI. The picture quality in low light is too good and vibrant, the blacks do look like blacks (not a low contrast image), many of the colors bloom and it’s wonderful.\\nThe Video have soo much better stabilisation and even you can switch from one lens to another while shooting. The quality is again the best out there.\\nCamera shutter is really fast and better. And clicks are responsive.\\nThough zoom quality is not that good but why you wanna zoom if you have a composed image.\\n- The Battery Life is quite nominal like it can work after a whole day usage. If your Screen time is around 5hrs 30mins it can go from 100 to 28-30%.\\nPS : Battery Saver works really well, can extend upto minutes of Battery Life.\\n- The Haptic touch is far better than the Androids. Feedback is really good.\\n- The shape is quite good handful! Curved edges does gives 2019 vibes but yeah the phone works pretty well in 2021.\\n- I agree that you gonna miss Android features but iPhone has it’s own resemblance. iOS have now comparable features as to android even some are better.\\n\\nAt the end I’d Recommend this. Even if you’re switching from iPhone 6S or 7, this might be your another jumpad! And to Android users yeah this device is worth the Money.',\n",

The earphones that I got with the phone have an amazing sound quality. I miss the audio jack and touch ID though. Still feels pretty overpriced as compared to Android phones with great specifications. But then again, those phones dont have what ios can offer. A 12 mp ios camera is better than a 64 mp android camera. And better UI than android phones. So if you’re a photo junkie, go for it. They could have priced the phone lower though.',\n",

It seems some conspiracy is going on against Amazon to tarnish it's goodwill in the market. If you see the recent incidents about fake apple products most of them are from Delhi, Noida,and UP. It's done my people working as a support staff. I have exceptional experience specially with Amazon I will treat Amazon way better than Flipkart or any other online portal. They always deliver the product before time and you can trust them 200% as far as product quality and services are concerned. I won't write much about the product because it's apple it doesn't require any introduction. It's amazon + apple trust with quality so it's going to be one of the life time experience for everyone.

Upgraded from a 4inch iPhone SE 1st gen, so phone felt big and overwhelming at first! but now adjusted. Pretty confusing color choices for guys, really bored of white and black colors, red is nailpolish color. Finally settled for purple, purchased a blue case to go with it (i feel best color to go with purple phone). Finally, the phone is awesome as expected :) . When compared to other OLED screens, LCD screen has slight less brightness, especially if u tilt the phone. But when not comparing, its really fine (do switch off true tone if u want to see full potential of screen colors, brightness. but i suggest keep it on for daily use). Finally, Assembled in India clearly written on the box! (including the charger). i understand some parts inside phone still comes from across the border, but more Indians buying iphones may push Apple to mfg more internal parts in India. very satisfied that less of my money went across the border :)',\n",

       " 'Well well well! The most hyped iPhone of the year isn’t quite there at least not for me.\\nIt has a best camera undoubtedly, but the other side of the coin is not that good. So I was an android user, 1 Plus more specifically. I was excited to switch to the iPhone as most of you maybe. Amazon was pretty good at the delivery and I got it within 3 days. During my first day usage I noticed a slight warm feeling on the right side of my phone from top to bottom on the back. It was prominent and I could feel the heat that was generated. I looked online and fixed some setting like location and notifications which would put a lot of pressure on your battery. So i thought it is fixed but it wasn’t.\\nTo be honest I never thought of iPhones getting warm within a few minutes of youtube playback or social networking on WhatsApp or Instagram. It was all that I had never thought of. My onePlus 6 was a beast in this matter and half the price of iPhone 11, nonetheless I used it for a few days and kept looking for solutions but all would say it is quite normal for an iPhone to get warm.\\nTo be on the safer side I thought of replacement but Amazon won’t allow you unless you have a job sheet from an authorised apple service centre, which was quite new for me. As earlier no matter the cost of the product a replacement window was always open. A disappointment then!\\nSo with a heavy heart I headed towards the iPhone Service Centre some 15 kms away from my place. While reaching there I put forward my issues and they were like sir it is quite normal for the iPhones unless you get a warning of over heating. They were not ready to make a job sheet instead suggested for a diagnostic test, which came out normal.\\nIt has been a week now, I can still feel that warmth on the right side of my phone and I suppose I have to get used to it.\\nTalking about the other things the phone offers, Camera quality is the best, you get some awesome video and audio quality. A top notch I must say.\\nYou will have to cautiously use it for a longer battery life.\\nThe charging brick is good for a normal user, it is a bit slow in charging but it is not necessary to spend some ₹3000 plus fo a new charger and a cable.\\nFace recognition is fast but I still miss my fingerprint in times of this Pandemic.\\nSo the bottom line is worst Amazon Experience, you better buy it from an authorised dealer or go to appleonlinestoreindia for some good deals.\\nAnd yeah! winter is coming so I have got it covered thanks to iPhone 11:) Cheers!!!',\n",

The phone is working perfectly and smoothly. The iPhone 11 offers excellent battery life for the form factor it is. I do not need to charge it frequently and it is lasting me the entire day with a single charge even though I use it moderately from making calls, to taking pics, to gaming and browsing web on Safari. Finally listening to music before calling it a day. At the end of the day the battery percentage remains near 14%- 20%. This wasn't the case with my previous Samsung Galaxy S6 & S7 which hardly lasted even half a day on full charge.\\nThe bundled charger is sufficient for my needs. Though the 5W charger is small and ancient it is ok as I charge it only once in a day. If you want fast charging you may have to buy the 20 W charger and cable separately from Apple. Also the bundled earpods are good, though I do not use them but my wireless headphones. Technically you cannot fault the iPhone for performance. Anything you throw at it, it performs more than your expectation. Calls, gaming, 4G, video, facetime, photos all performed excellently. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it.\",\n",

       " 'After using it for around 10 months, now I’m giving my review. Really. Now, I can feel why iOS users don’t want to shift to an Android device. I don’t gonna explain unnecessary things. But one thing is sure that Android is nothing in front of iOS due to its open-source nature. Every brand is offering good display, good camera, flagship processor and more. But there is no match with real life performance with iPhone 11. You can still go for 11 instead of 12 or 12 mini as it will worth every penny for a long run. If you’re addicted to customizations or so many false myths then you should stick with Android. iPhone really teaches you a true meaning of a smartphone and what it should be. Hope you guys understand. Final words: it’s like an investment that will show its true value in the long term period.',\n",
       " 'Some checks to validate that the iphone is brand new:\\n\\n- Once you setup your phone, navigate to Apple check coverage on website and validate that Warranty date is exactly one year from the date you setup your phone.\\n- Check for Battery Health. For a new phone it should be 100%.\\n\\nThere is also one more unofficial check related to serial number starting with a particular letter (M,N,F,P). Although Apple claims no such checks exists, many people on Apple forums say that the checks do exist unofficially. If serial number start with \"M\" its a new phone, if its either \"F or N\" its refurbished or used device.\\n\\nThe mobile was delivered safely and after all the checks, it\\'s all good for me.',\n",
       " 'I was a bit skeptical to order or not reading some negative feedback in the reviews section. Thankfully, i did not face any issues with the seller or the product.my phone was well packed and sealed and delivered within the stipulated time. warranty too was one year after activation of the phone .\\n\\nAs for the phone, its just awesome, fast, great battery, great camera. If you are looking for an upgrade and want to purchase the iphone 11, go ahead.',\n",
       " \" Pros:\\nI’ve always loved the look of iPhone 11, the phone looks good and has a nice weight to it. The dual speaker audio is crazy! Display being a LCD is still pretty neat looking. Setting up e-sim is very easy. Primary camera is exceptional. Face ID is just as better as it can get. Bright light or pitch black it recognises your face without any issue.\\n\\nCons:\\nI didn’t believe it at first, but yes my phone does have heating issues especially while gaming, and not even heavy games, even the basic puzzle games makes it heat up, and restarts the phone randomly. The display is usually visible but can be a bit difficult in sunlight. WhatsApp msgs cannot be transferred from Android to iOS so I have to carry both, my OnePlus 8 pro for WhatsApp and iPhone for everything else. (I wanted to scrap my OP8pro because it’s Chinese) The ultra wide camera works well in well lit areas only. Even if it’s a little shady like below a tree, it has way too much noise. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE 5watt CHARGER WHICH COMES WITH IT! It’ll take atleast 2.5 hours to charge your phone, so I always have to carry my charger everywhere and end up sitting near a plug just to charge it, it’s extremely frustrating. And lastly I miss fingerprint scanner, because I’m always wearing a mask and cannot face id.\\n\\nOverall it’s a great phone, and being able to use a few google tools on iPhones makes it better.\\n\\nEDIT: After 1 year of usage, this isn't a phone it's simply an inconvenience, and the worst RAM management ever, once your phone is full with media, it's close to impossible to transfer photos to a HD or a Laptop it keeps on giving errors, I'm trying for months, and so it's full, the apps continuously keep crashing and phone heats up a lot. I wish to use a huge hammer on it, and if that Steve Jobs wasn't dead already, I'd be after him to not kill but torture him the way he's doing me. DO NOT R.I.P. newb.\",\n",

You can pass a day or two very easily doing normal tasks but yeah the 5W charger in the box is very slow so if you’re not getting a charger from now it’s not bad.\\n\\nWhen it comes to camera the detail and all is very accurate, portrait mode does exceptionally well and the video recording is supported up to 4K 60fps. Obviously you can’t enjoy it in 720p screen but it’s there.\\n\\nSo overall the iPhone 11 delivers the best value for money now that it’s around 55k so definitely if you’re going to buy your first iPhone just like me you should definitely go for it.',\n",
